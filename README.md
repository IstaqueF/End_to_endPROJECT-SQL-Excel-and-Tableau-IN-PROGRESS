Project: To find relevant information from Movies DB and find correlation and pattern

I have answered the below question to analyze the DB 
Question 1: Top 5 actor's movies that have been rented the most during the period of the analysis 
Question 2 : Top 5 popular categories 
Question 3: find the list of rental rate per category
Question 4 : Find the difference in price between most expensive and least expensive categories 
Question 5 : Select the average rental hours per category 
Question 6: Now let's find out if rental time changes between two stores

See below EER diagram of the DB I have worked with
